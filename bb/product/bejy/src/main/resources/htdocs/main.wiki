      Furthermore webapps and WAR archives are fully supported.
      The JSP engine implements the final spec 1.2

//[gfx/show.gif] Getting Started

Depending on your scenario you need to do some preconfigurations:
*__BEJY as web container with JSP support:__
*#Install the JDK in addtion (or instead) of the JRE, since a JAVA compiler is required
*#Configure the Java compiler by
*#modify the start script and add <jdk>/lib/tools.jar to the classpath <b>or</b>
*#modify bejy.xml and specify the full path to the javac executable <b>or</b>
*#modify the global search path so the correct javac os found
*__BEJY as mail server:__
*# Obtain and install a supported database - currently one of those:
*#* MySQL 3.x or newer - developer tested and productive - available at [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/]
*#*MSSQL 2000 or newer - developer tested - available at [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads]
*#*Oracle 8.x or newer - developer tested - available at [http://www.oracle.com/database/index.html]
*#*HSQLDB 1.8 or newer - developer tested  - available at [http://hsqldb.org]
*#Create a database for the mail database tables.
*#Create a user for BEJY which requires full rights to the mail database.
*#Obtain the correct JDBC driver which matches your database and put into the lib folder.
*#modify the start script and add the JDBC driver to the classpath
*#Now restart BEJY and use the email wizard at [http://localhost:8081/admin/w_mail.jsp] to configure the rest.

For further configurations the admin UI at [http://localhost:8081/admin/] should be used.
The initial username is **admin**, the initial password is empty, nothing, nada - leave it blank!

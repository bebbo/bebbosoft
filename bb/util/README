This is a compilation of classes which grew over the years and are still useful for me.

Starting with 15. March 2008 this package is published using the GPL v 3. Feel free to use is as long you stick to the license.

Please mail feedback, wishes, improvements and so on to s.franke@bebbosoft.de
Maybe I will setup a project at sourceforge or something similar...
